#What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology



#In object-oriented programming (OOP) terminology, instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance (object) of a class. When you define a class in Python (or any other object-oriented language), you are essentially creating a blueprint or a template that describes the attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess.
