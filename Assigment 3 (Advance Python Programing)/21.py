#What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java


"""Python classes provide all the standard features of Object 
Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows 
multiple base classes, a derived class can override any 
methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the 
method of a base class with the same name."""

"""Python supports inheritance, it even supports multiple 
inheritance"""
