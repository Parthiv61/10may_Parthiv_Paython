"What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?"""

"""When the expression "1" == 1 is executed in Python, it compares a string "1" with an integer 1 using the equality operator (==). The result of this comparison will be False.

In Python, the equality operator (==) checks whether the values of two operands are equal. However, it does not consider their types. In this case, the string "1" and the integer 1 have different types, so they are considered not equal, even though they both represent the same numerical value.

Here's a breakdown of the comparison:

    "1" is a string literal.
    1 is an integer literal.

Since their types are different, the comparison evaluates to False, indicating that the string "1" is not equal to the integer 1."""
